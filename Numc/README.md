### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 8
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): ???
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - It was enjoyable and i did enjoy optimizing but I think that it was also the most annoying and the hardest part. At least the guide did provide a way to do it and pass the cases
- What did you learn?
  - We learned about applying SIMD and OPENMP to help improve performance and optimize tasks that can be done with multiple threads. Also learned about cache blocking and unrolling in SIMD.
- Is there anything you would change?
  - I personally might make part 1 less of a "part" since obviously the focus was almost entirely on part 2. Part 1 didnt actually teach you that much, instead it just helped you understand the project. Maybe make it a bit shorter, just enough to get the general idea then spend more time on part 2 since that is the more important and interesting part.
