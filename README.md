# WorkSamples

In this folder, there are 4 projects that I would like to share: 2 computer science course projects, 1 lab project, and 1 CalSol project. Class projects only show files modified.

Numc
Course: Machine Structures (April, 2022)
Professor(s): Nicholas Weaver, Conan McHanon
Description: Optimized logical operations such as vector and matrix multiplication using Openmp and SIMD in C. 

Search 
Course: Artificial Intelligence (September, 2022)
Professor(s): Igor Mordatch, Peyrin Kao
Description: Using OOP in Python, implemented DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* search algorithms and visualized them with Pacman finding a path to pellet or eating all pellets on the map. 

S1xt33n Lab
Course: Designing Information Devices and Systems II (Spring, 2022)
Professor(s): Vladimir M Stojanovic, Murat Arcak
Description: Over the course of semester, my partner and I implemented linear algebra concepts of sensing, controls, and classification using tools like Energia and numpy in order to program and build a functional car that would move a certain direction using voice commands. Demonstrates a strong understanding of linear algebra fundamentals such as vectors and matrices. 

Parser/Decoder (October, 2022)
Club: Calsol, solar panel competitive car team at University of California, Berkeley
Program Director: William Ang
Description: Part of an Android debugger app for car, used Java to parse C header files in order to map variables and structures to a can ID and construct a decoder for every declaration. Goal was to make an intuitive tool to decode a payload, an array of bytes, and return accurate data. Learned to use IAST Eclipse and worked with constructive feedback through code reviews on github.
